## Price to Earnings Ratio 
P/E Ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio): The P/E ratio is a measure of a company's current share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). A higher P/E ratio generally suggests that investors are willing to pay more for the company's earnings, often indicating optimism about future growth prospects.
                
## Methodology for Calculating P/E Ratio
Calculated as the current share price divided by the earnings per share (EPS)

## Median P/E Ratio
Computed the median P/E ratio for each industry to identify typical valuations.When we calculate the median P/E ratio for a particular industry, we're finding the middle value of all the P/E ratios for companies within that industry. Unlike the mean (average), which can be influenced by extreme values, the median represents the middle value when all values are sorted in ascending order. So, the median P/E ratio gives us a more robust measure of the typical valuation within the industry.

Recommendations based on findings
Diversify Investments: Consider spreading investments across industries with high P/E ratios to mitigate risks.
Growth Potential: Focus on industries with higher median P/E ratios for potential high growth returns. Market Trends: Stay updated on market trends that might impact P/E ratios. Valuation Considerations: Balance between high P/E (growth stocks) and low P/E (value stocks) based on risk appetite.

Using this decision tree model, revenue growth can only be used to explain 24% of the variance in stock price growth and volatility. The model only explains a small portion of variability in stock returns.

## Double click: Electronic gaming and multimedia
An RMSE of 0.38377 indicates that, on average, the difference between the predicted values and the actual values is about 0.38377 units. A RMSE of 0.38377 indicates a moderate level of error.

## Conclusions
Our best model has an accuracy of 79% which is better than the market average for similar models.
